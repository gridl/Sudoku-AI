# Sudoku-AI
An AI Agent that can solve any Sudoku with an unique solution (or find one the multiple solutions). 

In this repository you will find a python notebook (Sudoku AI.ipynb [File](https://github.com/michelucci/Sudoku-AI/blob/master/Sudoku%20AI.ipynb)) that you can directly read in github.

Feel free to use the code as you like. If you do or refer to it somewhere online a reference or a thank you would be nice. ;-)
